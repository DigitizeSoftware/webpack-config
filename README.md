# webpack-config

## Summary
This package is intended to help bootstrap and easily edit your Webpack config. I created it when I got annoyed reading webpack documenation every time I bootstrap a new project or need to update the configuration of the existing one.

## How it works?
Call the exported function `webpackConfig()` with simple set of options (description TBD) and it will return a webpack configuration object which you can export from your `webpack.config.js` to build a project with minimum efforts.

The in-depth documentation is on the way. In the meantime please read through the source code.
