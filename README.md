# webpack-config

## Summary
This package is intended to help bootstrap and easily edit your Webpack config. I created it when I got annoyed reading webpack documenation every time I bootstrap a new project or need to update the configuration of the existing one.

## How it works?
Call the exported function `createWebpackConfig()` with simple set of options and it will return a JSON-object that you can pass to webpack to run a project with minimal effort.

The in-depth documentation is on the way. In the meantime please read through the comments in the source code.
